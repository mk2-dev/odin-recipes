<h3>Lasagna Recipe</h3>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheeses.</p>

<h4>Ingridients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>9 Lasagna Noodles</li>
    <li>1 lbs Ground Beef</li>
    <li>2 Cups Mozerella Cheese</li>
    <li>24oz Desired Pasta Sauce</li>
    <li>2 Cups Water</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Set your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Boil 9 lasagna noodles in salted water until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Brown 1 pound of ground beef in a skillet over medium heat.</li>

    <li>Drain any excess fat.
        Add a 24-ounce jar of pasta sauce to the beef and let it simmer for a few minutes to blend the flavors.</li>

    <li>In a bowl, combine 2 cups of ricotta cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon of salt,
        1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder,
        1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>

    <li>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread 1 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom.
        Place 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce.
        Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
        Top with 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce.
        Repeat the layers (noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce) two more times, ending with the meat sauce.
        Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese over the top.</li>

    <li>Pour 2 cups of water around the edges of the assembled 
        lasagna. This helps cook the noodles and keeps the lasagna moist.
    </li>

    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly.</li>

    <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before cutting and serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to slice.</li>

</ol>
